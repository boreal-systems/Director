# Boreal Systems Director Link

This package allows you to interface local USB controllers with a remote core over the network, it currently supports Elgato Streamdeck Minis (will support the rest when I have access to them again)

# Developement
Lots of yarn scripts, really bad code.

# Deployment
`yarn workspace link run release` will produce executable builds in ./dist
