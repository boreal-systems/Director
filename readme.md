# Boreal Director
A Broadcast Orchestration Platform. 

Effective Jan 1st 2022, Boreal Director is no longer actively maintained.

Due to changes in my employment (funnily enough, as a result of this project)
I no longer have the time nor motivation to continue in depth development on it.

I will attempt to continue occasional maintenance with security and stability updates,
but will not be adding any features for the foreseeable future, the whole 
thing may be revived at some point in the future when circumstances change 
but don't count on it.

Feel free to hack it and use it to learn about React/NodeJS and Broadcast Control
and hopefully it can help you gain a better understanding of the broadcast world 
like it did for me. I got a good job out of it so while it hasn't achieved it's
original goal of changing how we think of broadcast control, it did change how I 
get to interact with and solve problems in the work I do, so it's not all bad.

Huge thank you to everyone who helped with design, development, testing, 
and feedback. Without you I would have had no hope of learning as much as I did
nor had the chance to develop something that could be practically used in a 
large scale production. 

Thanks for coming on the journey and I'm sorry it didn't last very long.
Keep doing great things, Oliver Herrmann
